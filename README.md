# Introduction
Are you a Skript hater? Is Skript annoying you? Your code just won't work?

This script, called **"NoSK"** is designed for users who want to **completely** remove all syntax and functionality from Skript. This script can be useful for those who want to start with a completely clean slate, without any functionality. By using the effect `punish skript`, you can strip Skript of **any and all syntaxes**, leaving **nothing** behind.

# Requirements
- Skript 2.6.x
- skript-reflect 2.3  

**Note**: This script was made to work with the upcoming 2.7 update and will be updated if it breaks in 2.8 or above.

**PS**: You can get your syntaxes back by restarting the server.
